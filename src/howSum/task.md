# How Sum
Write a function `howSum(target, numbers)` that takes in a targetSum and an array of numbers as arguments.

The function should return an array containing any combination of elements that add up to exactly the target sum.

If there is no combination tat adds up to the targetSum, then return null.

If there are multiple combinations possible, you may return any single one.
